# Flickr-Image-Caption-Generator

DSCI 471 Applied Deep Learning | Spring 2024 | Final Project

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build an image caption generator using deep learning. Our objective is to generate relevant captions by accurately recognizing the content of images. To achieve this, we used a CNN-RNN model and trained it on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets, following the methodologies outlined in the referenced guides.
